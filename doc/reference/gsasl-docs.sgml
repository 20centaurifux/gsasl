    <title>GNU SASL API Reference Manual</title>

    <para>
GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms.  SASL is
used by network servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication
from clients, and in clients to authenticate against servers.
    </para>
    <para>
GNU SASL contains of a library (`libgsasl'), a command line utility
(`gsasl') to access the library from the shell, and a manual.  The
library includes support for the framework (with authentication
functions and application data privacy and integrity functions) and at
least partial support for the CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS,
PLAIN, SECURID, DIGEST-MD5, LOGIN, NTLM mechanisms.
    </para>
    <para>
The library is easily ported because it does not do network
communication by itself, but rather leaves it up to the calling
application.  The library is flexible with regards to the
authorization infrastructure used, as it utilizes callbacks into the
application to decide whether a user is authorized or not.  GNU SASL
has been ported to many Unix flavors.
    </para>
    <para>
GNU SASL is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows, and many
kind of devices including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.
