* Changes in 0.0.8 (unreleased)

** Improved GSSAPI implementation detection.
Auto detection should work, unless you have both MIT and Heimdal, or
wish to override the default that prefer GSS over Heimdal over MIT.
In that case, use --enable-gssapi=mit or --enable-gssapi=heimdal.

** GNU SASL contain APIs for internationalized string processing via SASLprep.
You no longer have to use Libidn directly.

** Man pages for all public functions are included.

** GNULib is used for compatibility functions.
The directory gl/ is dedicated for GNULib functions, and replace the
earlier ad-hoc usage of argp, memset, etc.

** GNU SASL will be C89 compatible.
The library itself (lib/*) only use C89.  The remaining parts (src/
and tests/) can use C89 and any functionality from GNULib.  This
decision may be revised in the future, if it turns out there are
problems with this.

** Improvements for embedded or otherwise limited systems.
The math library (-lm) is no longer required.  All client code can be
disabled by --disable-client, and all server code can be disabled by
--disable-server.  The internationalized string processing library can
be disabled by --without-stringprep.

** Gettext 0.12.1 and Libtool 1.5 is used.

** Libgcrypt from CVS (1.1.42) is not supported.
Recent libgcrypt is API incompatible with earlier released versions.
If a too recent version is installed, it will not be used.

** Fix command line tool '--connect --imap' on Solaris.

** Bug fixes.

** API and ABI modifications.
Gsasl_client_callback_maxbuf: CHANGED: 'int' was replaced with 'size_t'.
Gsasl_server_callback_maxbuf: CHANGED: 'int' was replaced with 'size_t'.
gsasl_client_mechlist: NEW.
gsasl_server_mechlist: NEW.
gsasl_client_listmech: DEPRECATED: use gsasl_client_mechlist instead.
gsasl_server_listmech: DEPRECATED: use gsasl_server_mechlist instead.
gsasl_stringprep_nfkc: NEW.
gsasl_stringprep_saslprep: NEW.
gsasl_stringprep_trace: NEW.

* Changes in 0.0.7 (released 2003-06-02)

** Two new GSS libraries supported for the GSS-API mechanism.
See http://josefsson.org/gss/ for GSS, which uses Shishi for Kerberos 5.
See http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/ for Heimdal (Kerberos 5).

** Bug fixes.

* Changes in 0.0.6 (released 2003-03-17)

** Gettext not included.
Due to some conflicts between libtool and gettext, if you want i18n on
platforms that does not already have a useful gettext implementation,
you must install GNU gettext before building this package.  If you
don't care about i18n, this package should work fine (except for i18n,
of course).

** Rudimentary support for KERBEROS_V5.
Only enable if you want to write code.  This adds two new API errors;
GSASL_KERBEROS_V5_INIT_ERROR, GSASL_SHISHI_ERROR.

** Added API function: gsasl_client_callback_realm_set.
Specifies which realm the client belongs to.

** Bugfixes.
User visible aspects includes not building the API Reference Manual
with GTK-DOC by default, if you want it use configure parameter
--enable-gtk-doc.

* Changes in 0.0.5 (released 2003-01-27)

** Command line application "gsasl" now supports --imap and --connect.
The --imap parameter makes it use a IMAP-like negotiation on
stdin/stdout.  The --connect parameter makes it connect to a host over
TCP, and talk to it instead of stdin/stdout.  This allows it to be
used as a simple test tool to connect to IMAP servers.  Currently
integrity and confidentiality is not working properly, so if you use
DIGEST-MD5 you currently have to specify --quality-of-protection=auth.

** Texinfo documentation added for command line tool.

** Libgcrypt initialization no longer causes a warning to be printed.

** Added API reference manual in HTML format, generated using GTK-DOC.
See doc/reference/, in particular doc/reference/html/index.html.

** GNU Libidn replaces Libstringprep.
Although it is still stored in the libstringprep/ directory for CVS
reasons.

** Bug fixes for DIGEST-MD5 and GSSAPI.

* Changes in 0.0.4 (released 2002-12-13)

** License changed to GPL.

** Official GNU project.

* Changes in 0.0.3 (released 2002-12-05)

** New gsasl arguments --application-data and --no-client-first.

** Bug fixes (client sends first, memory leaks, compiler warnings, more).

* Changes in 0.0.2 (released 2002-11-07)

** Includes a copy of libstringprep 0.0.2 for Unicode NFKC
normalization and locale charset to UTF-8 string conversion, and
preparation for the future if a SASL Stringprep profile is created.
If libstringprep is already installed, it is used by default.  You can
force the use of the internal version with
--without-system-libstringprep.

** Uses pkg-config instead of libgsasl.m4 + libgsasl-config.in, and
for finding libntlm (requires libntlm 0.3.1 or later).

** Self tests for several mechanisms.

** The API now allows mechanisms to return data even when returning
GSASL_OK (earlier only on GSASL_NEEDS_MORE).

** Bug fixes.

* Changes in 0.0.1 (released 2002-10-12)

** APIs for integrity and confidentiality protection of application
payload data.

** DIGEST-MD5 support for integrity protection.

* Changes in 0.0.0 (released 2002-10-07)

** Initial release.
