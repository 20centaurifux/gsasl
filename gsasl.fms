Version: 0.2.3
Release-Focus: Major bugfixes

Fix example code to handle base64 encoded data properly.
Documentation fixes.  Fix self test bugs.  The NTLM mechanism now set
the 'domain' field to the GSASL_REALM property value.  The PLAIN
client no longer perform NFKC on strings.  The LOGIN client no longer
perform NFKC on strings.  The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism is disabled by
default, pending a rewrite for the new API.  LOGIN client now uses
authentication identity, not authorization identity.  PLAIN client now
work when no authorization identity is provided.  Callback backwards
compatibility improved.  A crash in the new base64 code was fixed.
Use of SASLprep in CRAM-MD5 improved.  The shared library version was
incremented.  Disabling Libidn/SASLprep should now result in a RFC
2222 compliant library.
