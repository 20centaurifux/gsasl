Libgsasl README -- important introductory notes
See the end for copying conditions.

This directory holds the library `libgsasl', which implement the
Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), and an application
`gsasl' for interfacing with the library from the command line.

Libgsasl is unstable and in its early steps of development.  You
should expect it to not work as well as having security problems.  The
API will likely change. Let me repeat that, LIBGSASL IS MOST LIKELY
INSECURE.

Currently there is some support for the following mechanisms:

  - CRAM-MD5 (RFC 2195, requires libgcrypt)
  - EXTERNAL (RFC 2222)
  - GSSAPI (RFC 2222, requires MIT Kerberos 5 GSSAPI library)
  - ANONYMOUS (RFC 2245)
  - PLAIN (RFC 2595)
  - SECURID (RFC 2808)
  - DIGEST-MD5 (RFC 2831, requires libgcrypt)
  - LOGIN (non-standard)
  - NTLM (non-standard, client only, requires libntlm)

Things left to do below.  If you like to start working on anything,
please let me know so work duplication can be avoided.

  + Authentication infrastructure implementing the callbacks for
    PAM, Kerberos, SQL, etc.  Separate project?  GNU Mailutils has
    some starting points for this, but the API is inflexible.
  + Hide explicit data array handling in a string API
  + Port applications to use libgsasl
  + More SASL mechanisms
  + Security layer improvements, including support for privacy
    separation (authenticate in one process, pass state to another).
  + Securid server fails self tests on alpha-unknown-openbsd3.1,
    I don't understand why.  Memory corruption?
  - Improve documentation
  - Port to Cyclone?
