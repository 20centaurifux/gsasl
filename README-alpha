GNU SASL README-alpha -- Important introductory notes for alpha releases.
See the end for copying conditions.

GNU SASL is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You should
expect it to have security problems.  The API will likely change.
This is the development release.  A proper release will be made in due
time.  Let me repeat that, GNU SASL IS MOST LIKELY INSECURE. DO NOT
USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!

The code will go through a security review before the stable release
is made.  Volunteers needed.

It will not become stable without help.  Donate time or money.
