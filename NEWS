** Libgsasl is an official GNU project.

* Changes in 0.0.3 (released 2002-12-05)

** New gsasl arguments --application-data and --no-client-first.

** Bug fixes (client sends first, memory leaks, compiler warnings, more).

* Changes in 0.0.2 (released 2002-11-07)

** Includes a copy of libstringprep 0.0.2 for Unicode NFKC
normalization and locale charset to UTF-8 string conversion, and
preparation for the future if a SASL Stringprep profile is created.
If libstringprep is already installed, it is used by default.  You can
force the use of the internal version with
--without-system-libstringprep.

** Uses pkg-config instead of libgsasl.m4 + libgsasl-config.in, and
for finding libntlm (requires libntlm 0.3.1 or later).

** Self tests for several mechanisms.

** The API now allows mechanisms to return data even when returning
GSASL_OK (earlier only on GSASL_NEEDS_MORE).

** Bug fixes.

* Changes in 0.0.1 (released 2002-10-12)

** APIs for integrity and confidentiality protection of application
payload data.
