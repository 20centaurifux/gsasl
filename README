This directory holds the library `libgsasl', which implement the
Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), and an application
`gsasl' for interfacing with the library from the command line.

Libgsasl is unstable and in its early steps of development.  You
should expect it to not work as well as having security problems.
Currently there is some support for the following mechanisms:

  - CRAM-MD5 (RFC 2195, requires libgcrypt)
  - EXTERNAL (RFC 2222)
  - GSSAPI (RFC 2222, requires MIT Kerberos 5 GSSAPI library)
  - ANONYMOUS (RFC 2245)
  - PLAIN (RFC 2595)
  - SECURID (RFC 2808)
  - DIGEST-MD5 (RFC 2831, requires libgcrypt)
  - LOGIN (non-standard)
  - NTLM (non-standard, client only, requires libntlm)

You probably need GNU make to build libgsasl (i.e., it sometimes work
with other make tools but not reliably).  Libgsasl has at some point
in time built on the following systems, but no guarantees.

  - alphaev67-dec-osf5.0 (Tru64 UNIX C, GNU make)
  - i686-pc-linux-gnu (Debian unstable)
  - i686-pc-linux-gnu (RedHat 7.2)
  - mips-sgi-irix6.5 (MIPS C compiler, GNU make)
  - rs6000-ibm-aix4.3.2.0 (GCC 2.9-aix43-000718, GNU make)
  - rs6000-ibm-aix4.3.2.0 (IBM C for AIX compiler, GNU make)
  - sparc-sun-solaris2.6 (Sun WorkShop Compiler C 5.0, non-GNU make)

Things left to do below.  If you like to start working on anything,
please let me know so work duplication can be avoided.

  * Encryption/integrity layers (gsasl_encode() and gsasl_decode())
  * Authentication infrastructure implementing the callbacks for
	 PAM, Kerberos, SQL, etc.  Separate project?
  + Port applications to use libgsasl
  + More SASL mechanisms
  - Improve documentation
  - Port to Cyclone?
