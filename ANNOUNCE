GNU SASL ANNOUNCE -- overview to attract interest
See the end for copying conditions.

GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms.  SASL is
used by network servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication
from clients, and in clients to authenticate against servers.

GNU SASL contains a library (`libgsasl'), a command line utility
(`gsasl') to access the library from the shell, and a manual.  The
library includes support for the SASL framework (with authentication
functions and application data privacy and integrity functions) and at
least partial support for the CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS,
PLAIN, SECURID, DIGEST-MD5, LOGIN, NTLM mechanisms.

The library is portable because it does not do network communication
by itself, but rather leaves it up to the calling application.  The
library is flexible with regards to the authorization infrastructure
used, as it utilizes callbacks into the application to decide whether
an user is authorized or not.

GNU SASL is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows.

GNU SASL is licensed under the GNU Public License.
