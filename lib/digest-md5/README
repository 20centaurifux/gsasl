(--- This README talks about the rewritten implementation, not all
part of it is yet in CVS. ---)

This directory hold an implementation of DIGEST-MD5.

This module is written in portable C89.  It may be used as a
stand-alone implementation, outside the framework that GNU SASL
provide.

The files CLIENT.C and SERVER.C contain the glue between GNU SASL and
the stand-alone implementation, read it to find out how to use the
module.

For updates to the project, see <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsasl/>.

Random notes follow.

* I initialled wanted to use abnf2perl from
  <http://www.cs.columbia.edu/sip/syntax/abnfperl/> to build a
  Flex/Yacc grammar for DIGEST-MD5, instead of parser.c.  However, the
  perl script did not seem to handle several some required construct,
  and did not generally seem finished.  Secondly, the Yacc generated
  code was difficult to read, and hence difficult to review.  I still
  wish to explore this way, because the current parser is too
  permissive, but don't have time now.

* It intentionally do not implement sub-sequent authentication.  If
  you are believe saving one round-trip make up for added code
  complexity, hire me to implement the missing pieces.
