See the end for copying conditions.

This directory hold an implementation of GS2.

This module is written in portable C89.  It may be used as a
stand-alone implementation, outside of the framework that GNU SASL
provide.

The files CLIENT.C and SERVER.C contain the glue between GNU SASL and
the stand-alone implementation.  Currently it is the best (only)
example on how to use the module.

For updates to the project, see <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsasl/>.
