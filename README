GNU SASL README -- important introductory notes
See the end for copying conditions.

This directory holds GNU SASL which is an implementation of the Simple
Authentication and Security Layer (SASL).  See ANNOUNCE for an
overview.

Currently there is some support for the following mechanisms:

  - CRAM-MD5 (RFC 2195, requires libgcrypt)
  - EXTERNAL (RFC 2222)
  - GSSAPI (RFC 2222, requires MIT Kerberos 5 GSSAPI library)
  - ANONYMOUS (RFC 2245)
  - PLAIN (RFC 2595)
  - SECURID (RFC 2808)
  - DIGEST-MD5 (RFC 2831, requires libgcrypt)
  - LOGIN (non-standard)
  - NTLM (non-standard, client only, requires libntlm)

Things left to do below.  If you like to start working on anything,
please let me know so work duplication can be avoided.

  * Bug: If gsasl_decode is handed a string longer than one SASL token,
    the remaining data will be discarded.  This means if the sender
    packed two SASL tokens in one network packet, only the first will be
    seen.  To fix this the best way, and the same time also improve
    string handling (security), the entire SASL step API probably
    should change.
  + Authentication infrastructure implementing the callbacks for
    PAM, Kerberos, SQL, etc.  Separate project?  GNU Mailutils has
    some starting points for this, but the API is inflexible.
  + Hide explicit data array handling in a string API
  + Port applications to use libgsasl
  + More SASL mechanisms
  + Security layer improvements, including support for privacy
    separation (authenticate in one process, pass state to another).
  + Securid server fails self tests on alpha-unknown-openbsd3.1,
    I don't understand why.  Memory corruption?
  - Improve documentation
  - Port to Cyclone?

(argp/, and libstringprep/) are distributed here for convenience and
