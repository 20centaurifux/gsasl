See the end for copying conditions.

To compile from version controlled sources rather than a
gsasl-*.tar.gz archive, you may need fairly recent versions of perl,
texinfo (4.7), GTK-DOC, gengetopt (2.12), libtool (1.5.2), autoconf
(2.61), and automake (1.10).  Bootstrap the build environment with:

  $ make
