GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms.  SASL is
used by network servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication
from clients, and in clients to authenticate against servers.

GNU SASL contains of a library, a command line utility to access the
library from shells and a manual.  The library includes support for
the framework (with authentication functions and application data
privacy and integrity functions) and at least partial support for the
CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS, PLAIN, SECURID, DIGEST-MD5,
LOGIN, NTLM mechanisms.

The library is easily ported because it does not do network
communication by itself, but rather leaves it up to the calling
application.  The library is flexible with regards to the
authorization infrastructure used, as it utilizes callbacks into the
application to decide whether a user is authorized or not.  GNU SASL
has been ported to many Unix flavors.
